    <h2 class="py-4 ml-12 mr-12 text-2xl">1.Difference between Var, Let, Const?</h3>
    <p class="ml-12 mr-12 py-2 ">Ans: Var is re-assignable as well as re-definable. <br> Where as Let is re-assignable and its not re-definable. <br> On the other hand, const is both not re-assignable and re-definable</p>
    <h2 class="py-4 ml-12 mr-12 text-2xl">2. Why would you use template string?</h3>
   
    <p class="ml-12 mr-12 py-2">Ans: Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags</p>



    <h2 class="ml-12 mr-12 py-2 text-2xl">3. Difference between map, forEach, filter, find?</h2>
    <p class="ml-12 mr-12 py-2">.map() when you want to transform elements in an array.</p>
    <p  class="ml-12 mr-12 py-2">If you're not familiar with the array method .forEach(), whenever you go to iterate over an
        array you probably immediately think of a for loop.The .forEach() method is just a different way of doing this.
     </p>

    
     <p class="ml-12 mr-12 py-2">.find() When you want to select a single element from an array.</p>
     <p class="ml-12 mr-12 py-2">The JavaScript .filter() array function is used to filter an array based on specified criteria.
        After filtering it returns an array with the values that pass the filter. The JavaScript filter function
        iterates over the existing values in an array and returns the values that pass.</p>
