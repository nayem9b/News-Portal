    <h3 class="py-4 ml-12 mr-12">1.Difference between Var, Let, Const?</h3>
    <p class="ml-12 mr-12 py-2">Ans: Var is re-assignable as well as re-definable. <br> Where as Let is re-assignable and its not re-definable. <br> On the other hand, const is both not re-assignable and re-definable</p>
    <h3 class="py-4 ml-12 mr-12">2. Why would you use template string?</h3>
   
    <p class="ml-12 mr-12 py-2">Ans: Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags</p>
